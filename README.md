# drawing-app

This aspires to be the best collaborative drawing app ever! ;)

I didn't have much time to work on this because I had coursework to attend to. (Spent an hour doing this) I will be working more on the following from this point.

* check for memory leaks
* must not redraw every single time
* must add to the user array, must not recreate every time
* handle errors
* must not have repeat any color
* code cleanup
